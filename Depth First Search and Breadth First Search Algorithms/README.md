This is a search algorithm visualizer using Depth First Search and Breadth-First Search algorithms.

For running this `python <Stack or Queue> <True or False for corners> <size>`. For Depth First Search you can write Stack on the terminal and Breadth-First Search you can write Queue in the terminal. Whether accepting corners as neighbors could be decided by writing True or False in the terminal. Finally, the size of the maze is decided by giving an integer value for the size parameter.

It is possible to put "Walls" or obstacles on the way by using mouse buttons.
