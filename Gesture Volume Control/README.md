# Gesture Volume Control

This program allows you to control your volume by using hands. It uses `mediapipe` Hand Detection algorithm to
detect hands and uses `OpenCV` to show the video and draw landmarks and volume indicators on the screen.

You can look how this program looks from this youtube [video](https://youtu.be/WAA-UV9EeAo).

`mediapipe` and `OpenCV` libraries are required.
