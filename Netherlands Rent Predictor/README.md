In this project I scrape data from `www.kamernet.nl`(One of the popular rental advertisement website in Netherlands) by using BeautifoulSoup. After scraping data I clean the data and make some Explanotary Data Analysis using various different plots including geographical plots using `geopandas`. Finally we apply some regression algorithms to see which one performs better.


Also, I created a webpage using the scraped data and algorithm with very good user interface. In this website user selects couple of options and based on selected options, it shows them houses that fits these criterions.
